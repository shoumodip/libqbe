# LibQBE
[QBE](https://c9x.me/compile/) as a C library.

## Quick Start
```console
$ ./build.sh
```

See the provided [demo/](demo/) for usage details.

## Why?
- The original QBE is a CLI application, which complicates distribution.
- LLVM does not generate C ABI compatible functions (It had one job :expressionless:).
